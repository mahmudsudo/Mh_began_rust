Beginners project in rust
 ### projects to showcase progress in rust
 <ol>
 <li>A git gui for seemless integration built purely with rust</li>
 <li> `lazymc` puts your Minecraft server to rest when idle, and wakes it up when
players connect.

Some Minecraft servers (especially modded) use an insane amount of resources
when nobody is playing. lazymc helps by stopping your server when idle, until a
player connects again.

lazymc functions as proxy between clients and the server. It handles all
incoming status connections until the server is started and then transparently
relays/proxies the rest. All without them noticing.</li>
<li>an app for sending files on android built with java and javascript</li>
<li> an early and amateur attempt to solve the two sums problem with rust</li>

 </ol>
